\title{As aze without missing values}
\description{
This is a single imputation of the \code{\link{aze}} dataset which was collected on patients carrying a colon adenocarcinoma. It has 104 observations on 33 binary qualitative explanatory variables and one response variable \code{y} representing the cancer stage according to the to Astler-Coller classification (Astler and Coller, 1954). A microsattelite is a non-coding DNA sequence.
